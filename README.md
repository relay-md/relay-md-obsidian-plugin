# Relay.md Obsidian plugin

This repo contains an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin for [relay.md](https://relay.md).

🎉 The purpose of relay.md is to make **sharing markdown files fun again**.

Relay.md enables **quick** and **easy** sharing of documents with a team and
allows to **subscribe** to individual subjects. Individual team members to share
their knowledge with the entire team from
within Obsidian.

* ❌ No more **copy&pasting** to share a document with your team.
* ❌ No more changing syntax because your mail client does not support Markdown
* ❌ No more moving your hands away from keyboard to your mouse
* ❌ No more looking up email addresses
* ✅ share your document with the right people in seconds

Finished writing a consultancy contract for *business B*, have them notified
Further, those that deal with different projects, teams or clients, can keep
their information aggregated within **as single vault** and send out their documents to
corresponding people from within Obsidian.

🤩 Send specification to the right people in your team using **topics**.
from within Obsidian by sending the docs via relay.md.
